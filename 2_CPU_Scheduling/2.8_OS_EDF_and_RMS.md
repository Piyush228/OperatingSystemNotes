# **Earliest Deadline First (EDF) & Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**  

## **1. Introduction to Real-Time Scheduling**  
In real-time systems, tasks must be scheduled to meet strict deadlines. The two most common **CPU scheduling algorithms for real-time systems** are:  
1. **Earliest Deadline First (EDF)** – A dynamic priority scheduling algorithm.  
2. **Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)** – A fixed-priority scheduling algorithm.  

Both are **preemptive scheduling** techniques used for real-time tasks, but they differ in how they assign priorities and manage deadlines.

## **2. Earliest Deadline First (EDF) Scheduling**  

### **How EDF Works?**  
- **Dynamic priority scheduling**: The task with the closest (earliest) deadline gets the highest priority.  
- At any time, if a new task arrives with an earlier deadline than the current running task, the CPU **preempts** the running task and executes the new one.  
- This approach ensures that the most time-critical tasks are completed first.  

### **Example of EDF Scheduling**  
#### **Given Tasks:**
| Task | Arrival Time (AT) | Execution Time (ET) | Deadline (D) |
|------|------------------|------------------|------------|
| T1   | 0 ms            | 2 ms             | 5 ms       |
| T2   | 1 ms            | 1 ms             | 7 ms       |
| T3   | 2 ms            | 3 ms             | 9 ms       |

#### **Step-by-Step Execution**  
1. **At time 0**, T1 starts execution (earliest deadline = 5).  
2. **At time 1**, T2 arrives (deadline = 7), but T1 continues as it has the earliest deadline.  
3. **At time 2**, T3 arrives (deadline = 9). T1 finishes, and the next task with the closest deadline (T2) runs.  
4. **At time 3**, T2 finishes, and T3 starts execution.  
5. **At time 6**, T3 finishes.  

#### **Gantt Chart Representation**  
```
| T1  | T1  | T2  | T3  | T3  | T3  |
 0    1    2    3    4    5    6
```

#### **Advantages of EDF**
✔ Ensures all tasks meet their deadlines if CPU utilization is ≤ 100%.  
✔ More flexible than fixed-priority scheduling (RMS).  
✔ Suitable for **soft and hard real-time systems**.  

#### **Disadvantages of EDF**
❌ **Overhead**: Continuous sorting of tasks based on deadlines.  
❌ **Context Switching**: Frequent preemptions lead to higher context switching.  
❌ **Not Practical for Low-Level Systems**: Requires complex implementation.

## **3. Rate Monotonic Scheduling (RMS)**  

### **How RMS Works?**  
- **Fixed priority scheduling**: Tasks with **shorter periods** (higher frequency) get **higher priority**.  
- **Preemptive**: A higher-priority task can **preempt** a lower-priority task at any time.  
- RMS assumes that tasks are periodic (repeat at fixed intervals).  

### **Example of RMS Scheduling**  
#### **Given Periodic Tasks:**  
| Task | Execution Time (ET) | Period (P) |
|------|------------------|------------|
| T1   | 1 ms             | 4 ms       |
| T2   | 2 ms             | 6 ms       |

- **T1 has a shorter period (4 ms), so it gets higher priority.**  

#### **Step-by-Step Execution**  
1. **At time 0**, T1 starts execution since it has the highest priority.  
2. **At time 1**, T1 completes, and T2 starts execution.  
3. **At time 4**, T1 arrives again (period = 4) and preempts T2.  
4. **At time 5**, T1 completes, and T2 resumes execution.  
5. **At time 6**, T2 completes.  

#### **Gantt Chart Representation**  
```
| T1  | T2  | T2  | T1  | T2  |
 0    1    2    3    4    5    6
```

#### **Advantages of RMS**
✔ Simple and easy to implement.  
✔ **Guaranteed schedulability** if CPU utilization is **≤ 69%** for multiple tasks.  
✔ Efficient for **hard real-time systems**.  

#### **Disadvantages of RMS**
❌ Less flexible than EDF.  
❌ Tasks with longer periods may suffer **starvation**.  
❌ **Utilization bound**: Cannot fully utilize CPU beyond **69% efficiency** for multiple tasks.

## **4. Comparison of EDF vs. RMS**

| Feature            | EDF (Earliest Deadline First) | RMS (Rate Monotonic Scheduling) |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Priority Type     | Dynamic (changes at runtime) | Fixed (based on period length) |
| Preemptive        | Yes                          | Yes                            |
| Efficiency        | 100% CPU utilization possible | **≤ 69% CPU utilization limit** |
| Complexity        | High (needs sorting by deadline) | Low (fixed priority)           |
| Flexibility      | High (works for soft & hard RT) | Low (only works for hard RT)   |
| Starvation       | No (tasks are scheduled by deadline) | Yes (tasks with long periods suffer) |

## **5. Diagram Representation**  
### **EDF Scheduling Concept**  
```
            T1 (D=5) ---> Higher Priority
            T2 (D=7)
            T3 (D=9) ---> Lower Priority
```
- **At each time unit, the task with the nearest deadline is executed first.**  

### **RMS Scheduling Concept**  
```
            T1 (P=4) ---> Highest Priority
            T2 (P=6) ---> Lower Priority
```
- **The task with the shortest period always gets higher priority.**

## **6. Key Takeaways**  
✔ **EDF is better for soft real-time systems**, while **RMS is best for hard real-time systems**.  
✔ **EDF allows full CPU utilization**, whereas **RMS is limited to ~69% utilization**.  
✔ **RMS is simple and predictable**, while **EDF requires more computation overhead**.
