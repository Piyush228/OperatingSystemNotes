## **1. Introduction to Round Robin (RR) Scheduling**
Round Robin (RR) is a **preemptive scheduling algorithm** where each process gets a **fixed time slice (time quantum)** for execution before being moved to the back of the ready queue.

- **Type:** Preemptive
- **Used For:** Time-sharing systems (like operating systems)
- **Preemption:** Yes, based on time quantum
- **Fairness:** Every process gets an equal CPU time

## **2. Working of Round Robin Scheduling**
1. **Processes are placed in a queue** in the order of arrival.
2. The **CPU executes the first process for a fixed time quantum (TQ)**.
3. If the process completes within the TQ, it exits.
4. If not, the process is **preempted** and placed at the end of the queue.
5. The next process in the queue gets the CPU, and the cycle repeats until all processes complete.

## **3. Example Execution of Round Robin Scheduling**
Consider the following **processes**:

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| P1      | 0 ms             | 5 ms            |
| P2      | 1 ms             | 3 ms            |
| P3      | 2 ms             | 8 ms            |
| P4      | 3 ms             | 6 ms            |

### **Step-by-Step Execution (Time Quantum = 3 ms)**
| Time | Process | Remaining Burst Time |
|------|---------|----------------------|
| 0-3  | P1      | 2                    |
| 3-6  | P2      | 0 (Completed)         |
| 6-9  | P3      | 5                    |
| 9-12 | P4      | 3                    |
| 12-14 | P1     | 0 (Completed)         |
| 14-17 | P3     | 2                    |
| 17-20 | P4     | 0 (Completed)         |
| 20-22 | P3     | 0 (Completed)         |

### **Final Table: Completion Time, Turnaround Time, and Waiting Time**
| Process | AT  | BT  | CT  | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|--------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0   | 5   | 14  | 14 - 0 = 14  | 14 - 5 = 9   |
| P2      | 1   | 3   | 6   | 6 - 1 = 5    | 5 - 3 = 2    |
| P3      | 2   | 8   | 22  | 22 - 2 = 20  | 20 - 8 = 12  |
| P4      | 3   | 6   | 20  | 20 - 3 = 17  | 17 - 6 = 11  |

### **Average Waiting Time**
\[
(9 + 2 + 12 + 11) / 4 = 8.5
\]

### **Average Turnaround Time**
\[
(14 + 5 + 20 + 17) / 4 = 14
\]

## **5. Java Code for Round Robin Scheduling**
```java
import java.util.*;

class Process {
    int id, at, bt, ct, tat, wt, remainingBT;

    Process(int id, int at, int bt) {
        this.id = id;
        this.at = at;
        this.bt = bt;
        this.remainingBT = bt;
    }
}

public class RoundRobin {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter number of processes: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        System.out.print("Enter time quantum: ");
        int tq = sc.nextInt();

        Process[] processes = new Process[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process " + (i + 1) + ": ");
            int at = sc.nextInt();
            int bt = sc.nextInt();
            processes[i] = new Process(i + 1, at, bt);
        }

        Queue<Process> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int currentTime = 0, completed = 0;
        float totalTAT = 0, totalWT = 0;
        
        Arrays.sort(processes, Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.at));

        int index = 0;
        while (completed < n) {
            while (index < n && processes[index].at <= currentTime) {
                queue.add(processes[index]);
                index++;
            }

            if (queue.isEmpty()) {
                currentTime++;
                continue;
            }

            Process current = queue.poll();
            int executionTime = Math.min(tq, current.remainingBT);
            currentTime += executionTime;
            current.remainingBT -= executionTime;

            while (index < n && processes[index].at <= currentTime) {
                queue.add(processes[index]);
                index++;
            }

            if (current.remainingBT > 0) {
                queue.add(current);
            } else {
                completed++;
                current.ct = currentTime;
                current.tat = current.ct - current.at;
                current.wt = current.tat - current.bt;
                totalTAT += current.tat;
                totalWT += current.wt;
            }
        }

        System.out.println("\nProcess\tAT\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT");
        for (Process p : processes) {
            System.out.println(p.id + "\t" + p.at + "\t" + p.bt + "\t" + p.ct + "\t" + p.tat + "\t" + p.wt);
        }

        System.out.println("\nAverage Turnaround Time: " + (totalTAT / n));
        System.out.println("Average Waiting Time: " + (totalWT / n));
    }
}

## **7. Key Takeaways**
✔ **Round Robin is preemptive**, ensuring fair execution for all processes.  
✔ **Minimizes starvation** since each process gets CPU time in a cyclic manner.  
✔ **Time Quantum is crucial**—too small causes high overhead, too large makes it behave like FCFS.  
✔ **It provides a balance** between response time and CPU efficiency.
