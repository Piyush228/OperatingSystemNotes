**Shortest Job First (SJF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm**

### **Introduction**
Shortest Job First (SJF), also known as Shortest Job Next (SJN), is a scheduling algorithm that selects the process with the smallest execution time from the waiting queue for execution. This approach minimizes the average waiting time for all processes.

### **Types of SJF Scheduling**
SJF can be categorized into two types:
1. **Non-preemptive SJF**: Once a process starts executing, it runs until completion.
2. **Preemptive SJF (Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF)**: A running process can be interrupted if a new process with a shorter burst time arrives.

### **Working of SJF Scheduling**
1. **Sorting**: All processes are sorted based on arrival time.
2. **Selection**: The process with the shortest burst time is chosen for execution.
3. **Execution**: The selected process runs until completion (non-preemptive) or can be interrupted (preemptive).
4. **Queue Management**: Once a process finishes, the scheduler selects the next shortest job from the ready queue.

### **Estimation Formula in SJF**
In some cases, the exact burst time of a process may not be known in advance. The estimated burst time for the next execution is calculated using the formula:

\[ T_{n+1} = \alpha \cdot t_n + (1 - \alpha) \cdot T_n \]

Where:
- \( T_{n+1} \) is the predicted burst time for the next process.
- \( T_n \) is the previously predicted burst time.
- \( t_n \) is the actual burst time of the previous process.
- \( \alpha \) is a smoothing factor (0 ≤ \( \alpha \) ≤ 1).

### **Characteristics of SJF Scheduling**
- Provides the minimum average waiting time among scheduling algorithms.
- Suitable for batch processing systems where burst times are known.
- Risk of **starvation**, where longer processes may never get scheduled.
- **Aging** can be used to overcome starvation by gradually increasing the priority of waiting processes.

### **Example of Non-Preemptive SJF Scheduling**
Consider the following processes:

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
|---------|------------------|----------------|
| P1      | 0 ms            | 6 ms          |
| P2      | 2 ms            | 8 ms          |
| P3      | 4 ms            | 3 ms          |

#### **Step-by-Step Execution**
1. At time 0, **P1** starts execution as it has the shortest burst time.
2. After **P1** completes at time 6, **P3** starts since it has the shortest burst time among available processes.
3. After **P3** completes at time 9, **P2** starts execution.
4. **P2** completes at time 17.

#### **Gantt Chart**
```
| P1 | P1 | P1 | P1 | P1 | P1 | P3 | P3 | P3 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 |
0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17
```

#### **Turnaround Time (TAT) & Waiting Time (WT)**
| Process | Completion Time (CT) | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
|---------|--------------------|--------------|--------------|
| P1      | 6                 | 6 - 0 = 6    | 6 - 6 = 0    |
| P2      | 17                | 17 - 2 = 15  | 15 - 8 = 7   |
| P3      | 9                 | 9 - 4 = 5    | 5 - 3 = 2    |

#### **Average Time Calculation**
- Average **Turnaround Time** = (6 + 15 + 5) / 3 = 8.6 ms
- Average **Waiting Time** = (0 + 7 + 2) / 3 = 3 ms

### **Advantages of SJF Scheduling**
- Minimizes average waiting time, making it more efficient than First Come First Serve (FCFS).
- Provides optimal Turnaround Time (TAT) when burst times are known.
- Works well in batch processing environments.

### **Disadvantages of SJF Scheduling**
- **Starvation**: Longer processes may never get executed if shorter jobs keep arriving.
- **Complexity**: Predicting burst times is difficult in real systems.
- **Not Practical**: Difficult to implement in real-time systems where burst times are unknown.

### **FAQs on SJF Scheduling**
1. **Can SJF be used in real systems?**
   - SJF is challenging to use in real systems as burst times are difficult to predict. However, it is effective in controlled batch processing environments.

2. **How does SJF compare to FCFS (First Come First Serve)?**
   - SJF generally performs better than FCFS in terms of waiting time and turnaround time. However, FCFS is simpler to implement and doesn’t suffer from starvation.

3. **Can SJF be preemptive?**
   - Yes, in the **preemptive** version (Shortest Remaining Time First - SRTF), a running process can be interrupted if a new process with a shorter burst time arrives.

4. **What is the impact of SJF on long-running processes?**
   - Long processes might suffer from starvation, meaning they may have to wait indefinitely if shorter processes keep arriving. This can be mitigated using the **aging** technique.

### **Conclusion**
The Shortest Job First (SJF) scheduling algorithm is one of the most optimal scheduling strategies in terms of minimizing average waiting time. However, its implementation challenges, such as burst time prediction and potential starvation, make it less viable for real-world systems. In practical applications, **aging** and dynamic priority adjustments are used to balance the advantages of SJF while mitigating its disadvantages.

## **Explaination**

### **Given Input**
| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| P1      | 1 ms             | 3 ms          |
| P2      | 6 ms             | 9 ms          |
| P3      | 3 ms             | 8 ms          |

---

### **Step-by-Step Execution**
Since **SJF is non-preemptive**, we first select the process with the **shortest burst time among the available processes**.

#### **1. Process Selection and Execution Order**
1. **Time = 1 ms:** P1 arrives first (only process available). So, P1 starts execution.
   - **P1 executes from time 1 to 4.**
   - Completion Time (CT) of **P1 = 4** ms.
   
2. **Time = 4 ms:** Processes **P2 and P3** are now available. We select the process with the shortest burst time.
   - **P3 (BT = 8) is shorter than P2 (BT = 9), so P3 starts execution.**
   - **P3 executes from time 4 to 12.**
   - Completion Time (CT) of **P3 = 12** ms.

3. **Time = 12 ms:** Only **P2** remains in the queue.
   - **P2 executes from time 12 to 21.**
   - Completion Time (CT) of **P2 = 21** ms.

### **Calculating Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT)**
| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) | Completion Time (CT) | Turnaround Time (TAT = CT - AT) | Waiting Time (WT = TAT - BT) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|
| P1      | 1 ms             | 3 ms          | **4** ms       | **4 - 1 = 3**  | **3 - 3 = 0**  |
| P3      | 3 ms             | 8 ms          | **12** ms      | **12 - 3 = 9** | **9 - 8 = 1**  |
| P2      | 6 ms             | 9 ms          | **21** ms      | **21 - 6 = 15** | **15 - 9 = 6** |

---

### **Average Time Calculations**
- **Average Turnaround Time (TAT)**  
  \[
  \frac{(3 + 9 + 15)}{3} = \frac{27}{3} = 9.0 \text{ ms}
  \]
  
- **Average Waiting Time (WT)**  
  \[
  \frac{(0 + 1 + 6)}{3} = \frac{7}{3} = 2.33 \text{ ms}
  \]

### **Final Execution Order (Gantt Chart)**
```
| P1 | P1 | P1 | P3 | P3 | P3 | P3 | P3 | P3 | P3 | P3 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 | P2 |
1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21
```

### **Key Takeaways**
1. **Process Execution Order:**  
   - **P1 → P3 → P2** based on shortest burst time availability.
2. **Why does P3 execute before P2?**  
   - At time = 4, both P3 and P2 are available, but P3 has the shorter burst time (8 < 9), so it gets executed first.
3. **Waiting Time Calculation:**  
   - P1 has no waiting time as it executes immediately.
   - P3 had to wait for P1 to finish (1 ms), and P2 had to wait for both P1 and P3 to finish (6 ms).
4. **Starvation Risk:**  
   - If a very short process arrives continuously, longer processes may have to wait a long time.
