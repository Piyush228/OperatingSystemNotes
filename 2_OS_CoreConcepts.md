## **ðŸ”¹ What is a Process?**
A **process** is an **active entity** that represents a running instance of a program. It contains:
- **Program Code (Text Section)** â€“ The actual instructions executed by the CPU.
- **Program Counter (PC)** â€“ Keeps track of the next instruction to execute.
- **Stack** â€“ Stores function calls, return addresses, local variables.
- **Heap** â€“ Stores dynamically allocated memory.
- **Data Section** â€“ Contains global/static variables.

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
When you open **Google Chrome**, multiple processes start running:
- One **main process** manages the UI.
- Separate **rendering processes** handle web pages.
- **Network processes** manage internet connections.

## **ðŸ“Œ Process Creation & Deletion**

### **ðŸ”¹ Process Creation**  
When a process is created, the OS performs the following steps:
1. **Assigns a Unique Process ID (PID).**
2. **Allocates Memory (Stack, Heap, Data, Code).**
3. **Loads the Program Code into Memory.**
4. **Initializes Registers & Process Control Block (PCB).**
5. **Schedules the Process in the Ready Queue.**

### **ðŸ”¹ Process Creation Example in C (Using `fork()`)**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int pid = fork(); // Creates a new process

    if (pid == 0) {
        printf("Child Process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
    } else {
        printf("Parent Process: PID = %d\n", getpid());
    }

    return 0;
}
```
ðŸ“Œ **Process Tree Created**
```
Parent Process (PID 1001)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Child Process (PID 1002)
```
âœ… **Each process gets a unique PID assigned by the OS.**

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Process Termination (Deletion)**
A process can be **terminated** due to:
1. **Normal Exit** â€“ Process finishes execution.
2. **Abort by Parent** â€“ Parent process terminates the child.
3. **Timeout** â€“ Exceeded execution time.
4. **Fatal Error** â€“ Segmentation fault, illegal instruction.
5. **Killed by Another Process** â€“ e.g., `kill` command in Linux.

ðŸ“Œ **Example: Killing a process in Linux**
```bash
ps
kill -9 <PID>
```

## **ðŸ“Œ Process States in OS**
A process **transitions** through various states:

### **ðŸ”¹ 5 States of a Process**
ðŸ“Œ **Diagram for Process States**
```plaintext
         +---------+
         |  New    |  (Process Created)
         +---------+
              â†“
        +---------+       +-----------+
  ----> |  Ready  | ----> | Running   |
  |     +---------+       +-----------+
  |            â†‘                |
  |            |                â†“
  |      +------------+    +-----------+
  |      |  Waiting   |    | Terminated |
  |      +------------+    +-----------+
  |            â†‘
  |            |
  +------------+
```

| **State** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **New** | Process is created but not yet scheduled for execution. |
| **Ready** | Process is waiting in the queue to be assigned a CPU. |
| **Running** | Process is being executed by the CPU. |
| **Waiting** | Process is waiting for I/O (e.g., reading a file). |
| **Terminated** | Process has completed execution and is removed from memory. |

ðŸ“Œ **Example:**  
- **Opening a Text Editor** â†’ Moves to **New** state.
- **Waiting for CPU time** â†’ Stays in **Ready** state.
- **Typing text** â†’ Moves to **Running** state.
- **Saving the file** â†’ Moves to **Waiting** state (I/O operation).
- **Closing the editor** â†’ Moves to **Terminated** state.

## **ðŸ“Œ Process Control Block (PCB)**
The **Process Control Block (PCB)** stores all information about a process.

### **ðŸ”¹ Structure of a PCB**
```
+---------------------------+
| Process ID (PID)          |
| Process State             |
| Program Counter (PC)      |
| CPU Registers             |
| Memory Information        |
| Open Files                |
| I/O Status                |
| Process Priority          |
+---------------------------+
```

ðŸ“Œ **Details Stored in PCB**
| **Field** | **Description** |
|-----------|----------------|
| **PID** | Unique process identifier |
| **State** | New, Ready, Running, Waiting, Terminated |
| **Program Counter** | Address of the next instruction to execute |
| **CPU Registers** | Stores process-specific register values |
| **Memory Info** | Base & limit registers, page tables |
| **I/O Status** | Devices allocated to the process |
| **Priority** | Used for scheduling decisions |

ðŸ“Œ **Diagram for PCB**
```plaintext
+------------------------------------------------+
| Process ID (PID) : 1234                        |
| State: Running                                 |
| Program Counter: 0x00432F                      |
| CPU Registers: {eax, ebx, ecx, edx}            |
| Memory: {Base: 0x1000, Limit: 0x2000}          |
| Open Files: {file1.txt, input.txt}             |
+------------------------------------------------+
```

âœ… **Why PCB is Important?**
- Helps OS **manage processes efficiently**.
- **Maintains process state** during context switching.
- Allows process **scheduling and execution tracking**.

## **ðŸ”¥ Final Thoughts**
- Every **running program is a process**.
- OS **manages multiple processes using process states**.
- **PCB stores process details** and is essential for multitasking.
- Understanding process creation (`fork()`), scheduling, and termination helps in **OS development & debugging**.
