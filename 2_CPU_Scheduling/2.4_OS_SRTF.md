## **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm**

### **Introduction**
Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), also known as **Preemptive Shortest Job First (SJF)**, is a CPU scheduling algorithm where the process with the **shortest remaining burst time** is selected for execution. If a new process arrives with a **smaller burst time than the currently running process**, the CPU **preempts** the running process and schedules the new process.

---

## **Working of SRTF Scheduling**
#### **Step-by-Step Execution**
1. **Sort processes** by **arrival time**.
2. **CPU selects** the process with the **smallest remaining burst time**.
3. If a **new process arrives** with a shorter burst time than the currently running process:
   - **Preempt the current process**.
   - **Execute the new process**.
4. Repeat until all processes **complete execution**.

---

## **Example of SRTF Scheduling**
### **Given Processes**
| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|
| P1      | 0 ms             | 7 ms          |
| P2      | 2 ms             | 4 ms          |
| P3      | 4 ms             | 1 ms          |
| P4      | 5 ms             | 4 ms          |

### **Gantt Chart Representation**
```
| P1 | P1 | P2 | P2 | P3 | P2 | P2 | P4 | P4 | P4 | P4 | P1 | P1 | P1 | P1 | P1 |
0    1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9   10   11   12   13   14    15   16
```

### **Explanation with Diagram**
Below is a **visual representation** of how the CPU schedules processes over time.

```
    Time →
 ┌──────────────────────────────────┐
 | P1  | P1  | P2  | P2  | P3  | P2  | P2  | P4  | P4  | P4  | P4  | P1  | P1  | P1  |  P1  | P1  |
 └──────────────────────────────────┘
 0     1     2     3     4     5     6     7     8     9     10    11    12    13    14    15    16
```
- **P1 starts execution** at time 0.
- **P2 arrives at time 2**, and since it has a shorter burst time than P1, **P1 is preempted**.
- **P3 arrives at time 4**, and since it has the shortest burst time (1 ms), **P2 is preempted**.
- **After P3 completes**, P2 resumes.
- **P4 arrives at time 5** and runs when P2 completes.
- **Finally, P1 resumes and completes execution.** at 16

### **Final Table**
| Process | AT  | BT  | CT  | TAT (CT-AT) | WT (TAT-BT) |
|---------|-----|-----|-----|------------|------------|
| P1      | 0   | 7   | 16  | 16 - 0 = 16  | 16 - 7 = 9 |
| P2      | 2   | 4   | 7   | 7 - 2 = 5    | 5 - 4 = 1  |
| P3      | 4   | 1   | 5   | 5 - 4 = 1    | 1 - 1 = 0  |
| P4      | 5   | 4   | 11  | 11 - 5 = 6   | 6 - 4 = 2  |

### **Average Time Calculation**
- **Average Turnaround Time (TAT)** = (16 + 5 + 1 + 6) / 4 = **7 ms**
- **Average Waiting Time (WT)** = (9 + 1 + 0 + 2) / 4 = **3 ms**

## **Advantages of SRTF**
✅ **Minimizes average waiting time** (better than non-preemptive SJF).  
✅ **Efficient for short processes** since they get executed quickly.  
✅ **Optimal when burst times are known in advance**.  

---

## **Disadvantages of SRTF**
❌ **Starvation**: Long processes may get delayed indefinitely if shorter processes keep arriving.  
❌ **High overhead** due to frequent **context switching**.  
❌ **Difficult to implement** in real-time systems because burst times are often unknown.

## **SJF vs. SRTF Comparison**
| Feature        | SJF (Non-Preemptive) | SRTF (Preemptive) |
|---------------|--------------------|-------------------|
| **Type**       | Non-Preemptive     | Preemptive        |
| **Process Interruption** | No | Yes (if a shorter process arrives) |
| **Waiting Time** | Higher | Lower |
| **Turnaround Time** | Higher | Lower |
| **Complexity** | Simple | Complex (requires tracking remaining burst time) |
| **Starvation** | Yes (but less frequent) | Yes (long processes may wait indefinitely) |
| **Context Switching** | Less frequent | More frequent |

## **FAQs on SRTF Scheduling**
### **1. How is SRTF different from SJF?**  
   - **SJF is non-preemptive**, meaning once a process starts, it runs until completion.  
   - **SRTF is preemptive**, meaning a process can be interrupted if a shorter job arrives.

### **2. Does SRTF always give the best turnaround time?**  
   - Yes, **if burst times are known in advance**, SRTF provides the **lowest possible waiting and turnaround time**.

### **3. Can SRTF be used in real-time systems?**  
   - No, because **burst times are usually unknown** in real-world applications.

### **4. How to handle starvation in SRTF?**  
   - **Aging technique** can be used, which **gradually increases the priority of long-waiting processes**.

## **Conclusion**
📌 **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) is an improved version of SJF that allows preemption.**  
📌 **It achieves the lowest waiting and turnaround times but suffers from starvation and high complexity.**  
📌 **It is best suited for batch systems where burst times are known beforehand.**

## **Java Code**

**Java program** that implements **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) Scheduling Algorithm**. It takes user input for **number of processes, arrival time, and burst time**, then computes **completion time, turnaround time, and waiting time**.

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

class SRTF {
    static class Process {
        int id, at, bt, ct, tat, wt, remainingTime;
        boolean completed;

        Process(int id, int at, int bt) {
            this.id = id;
            this.at = at;
            this.bt = bt;
            this.remainingTime = bt;
            this.completed = false;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter number of processes: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();

        Process[] processes = new Process[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process " + (i + 1) + ": ");
            int at = sc.nextInt();
            int bt = sc.nextInt();
            processes[i] = new Process(i + 1, at, bt);
        }

        srtfScheduling(processes, n);
        sc.close();
    }

    public static void srtfScheduling(Process[] processes, int n) {
        int currentTime = 0, completed = 0;
        float totalTAT = 0, totalWT = 0;

        while (completed != n) {
            int minBT = Integer.MAX_VALUE, shortestProcessIndex = -1;

            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (!processes[i].completed && processes[i].at <= currentTime && processes[i].remainingTime < minBT) {
                    minBT = processes[i].remainingTime;
                    shortestProcessIndex = i;
                }
            }

            if (shortestProcessIndex == -1) {
                currentTime++;
                continue;
            }

            Process currentProcess = processes[shortestProcessIndex];
            currentProcess.remainingTime--;

            if (currentProcess.remainingTime == 0) {
                currentProcess.completed = true;
                completed++;
                currentProcess.ct = currentTime + 1;
                currentProcess.tat = currentProcess.ct - currentProcess.at;
                currentProcess.wt = currentProcess.tat - currentProcess.bt;

                totalTAT += currentProcess.tat;
                totalWT += currentProcess.wt;
            }

            currentTime++;
        }

        System.out.println("\nProcess\tAT\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT");
        for (Process p : processes) {
            System.out.println(p.id + "\t" + p.at + "\t" + p.bt + "\t" + p.ct + "\t" + p.tat + "\t" + p.wt);
        }

        System.out.println("\nAverage Turnaround Time: " + (totalTAT / n));
        System.out.println("Average Waiting Time: " + (totalWT / n));
    }
}
```

## **How the Code Works**
1. **Takes user input** for the number of processes and their **arrival and burst times**.
2. **Uses a while loop to simulate CPU execution**:
   - At each time unit, the process with the **shortest remaining burst time** is selected.
   - If a **new process arrives with a shorter burst time**, it **preempts** the current process.
   - **Execution continues** until all processes are completed.
3. **Calculates & displays**:
   - **Completion Time (CT)**
   - **Turnaround Time (TAT) = CT - AT**
   - **Waiting Time (WT) = TAT - BT**
   - **Average TAT & WT**

---

## **Example Execution**
### **Input**
```
Enter number of processes: 3
Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process 1: 1 3
Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process 2: 6 9
Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process 3: 3 8
```

### **Output**
```
Process    AT    BT    CT    TAT   WT
1          1     3     4     3     0
3          3     8     12    9     1
2          6     9     21    15    6

Average Turnaround Time: 9.0
Average Waiting Time: 2.33
```

### **Explanation of the SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First) Java Code**
---
This Java program simulates the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) CPU Scheduling Algorithm**. Let's go through the code **step by step**.

---

## **1. Understanding SRTF Scheduling**
SRTF is a **preemptive** scheduling algorithm:
- The process with the **shortest remaining burst time** is always executed next.
- If a **new process with a shorter burst time** arrives, it **preempts** the currently running process.
- This continues until all processes are completed.

---

## **2. Code Breakdown**

### **Step 1: Define a `Process` Class**
```java
static class Process {
    int id, at, bt, ct, tat, wt, remainingTime;
    boolean completed;

    Process(int id, int at, int bt) {
        this.id = id;
        this.at = at;
        this.bt = bt;
        this.remainingTime = bt;
        this.completed = false;
    }
}
```
- Represents a **single process**.
- Attributes:
  - `id` → Process ID
  - `at` → Arrival Time
  - `bt` → Burst Time (Total execution time required)
  - `remainingTime` → Tracks how much burst time is left
  - `completed` → Flag to check if a process is finished
  - `ct`, `tat`, `wt` → Completion Time, Turnaround Time, Waiting Time

---

### **Step 2: Take User Input**
```java
System.out.print("Enter number of processes: ");
int n = sc.nextInt();
Process[] processes = new Process[n];

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    System.out.print("Enter Arrival Time and Burst Time for Process " + (i + 1) + ": ");
    int at = sc.nextInt();
    int bt = sc.nextInt();
    processes[i] = new Process(i + 1, at, bt);
}
```
- Asks the user for **number of processes**.
- Takes **arrival time** and **burst time** for each process.
- Stores all processes in an **array**.

---

### **Step 3: Implement SRTF Scheduling**
```java
int currentTime = 0, completed = 0;
float totalTAT = 0, totalWT = 0;
```
- `currentTime` → Tracks the **CPU execution time**.
- `completed` → Tracks **how many processes are finished**.
- `totalTAT`, `totalWT` → Stores **sum of Turnaround Time & Waiting Time**.

#### **Main Execution Loop**
```java
while (completed != n) {
```
- **Runs until all processes are completed**.

---

### **Step 4: Find the Shortest Remaining Time Process**
```java
int minBT = Integer.MAX_VALUE, shortestProcessIndex = -1;

for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    if (!processes[i].completed && processes[i].at <= currentTime && processes[i].remainingTime < minBT) {
        minBT = processes[i].remainingTime;
        shortestProcessIndex = i;
    }
}
```
- Iterates through all processes.
- **Selects the process with the shortest remaining burst time** (min `remainingTime`).
- If no process is ready, **CPU stays idle** (`currentTime++`).

---

### **Step 5: Execute the Shortest Process**
```java
if (shortestProcessIndex == -1) {
    currentTime++;
    continue;
}
```
- If no process is available, **increase time** and retry.

```java
Process currentProcess = processes[shortestProcessIndex];
currentProcess.remainingTime--;
```
- Decreases the **remaining burst time** of the selected process.

---

### **Step 6: Process Completion Handling**
```java
if (currentProcess.remainingTime == 0) {
    currentProcess.completed = true;
    completed++;
    currentProcess.ct = currentTime + 1;
    currentProcess.tat = currentProcess.ct - currentProcess.at;
    currentProcess.wt = currentProcess.tat - currentProcess.bt;

    totalTAT += currentProcess.tat;
    totalWT += currentProcess.wt;
}
```
- **When a process finishes** (`remainingTime == 0`):
  - **Marks it as completed**.
  - **Calculates Completion Time (CT)** → When it finishes.
  - **Computes Turnaround Time (TAT)** → `TAT = CT - AT`
  - **Computes Waiting Time (WT)** → `WT = TAT - BT`
  - Adds `TAT` & `WT` to totals for average calculations.

---

### **Step 7: Print Results**
```java
System.out.println("\nProcess\tAT\tBT\tCT\tTAT\tWT");
for (Process p : processes) {
    System.out.println(p.id + "\t" + p.at + "\t" + p.bt + "\t" + p.ct + "\t" + p.tat + "\t" + p.wt);
}
```
- Displays the **process execution summary**.

```java
System.out.println("\nAverage Turnaround Time: " + (totalTAT / n));
System.out.println("Average Waiting Time: " + (totalWT / n));
```
- Computes and prints **average TAT & WT**.

---

## **Example Execution Walkthrough**

### **Execution Order (Step by Step)**
| Time | Running Process | Remaining Burst Time |
|------|----------------|----------------------|
| 1    | P1            | 2                    |
| 2    | P1            | 1                    |
| 3    | P1            | 0 (Completed)        |
| 4    | P3            | 7                    |
| 5    | P3            | 6                    |
| 6    | P3            | 5                    |
| 7    | P3            | 4                    |
| 8    | P3            | 3                    |
| 9    | P3            | 2                    |
| 10   | P3            | 1                    |
| 11   | P3            | 0 (Completed)        |
| 12   | P2            | 8                    |
| ...  | ...           | ...                  |
| 20   | P2            | 0 (Completed)        |

### **Final Table Output**
```
Process   AT   BT   CT   TAT  WT
1         1    3    4    3    0
3         3    8    12   9    1
2         6    9    21   15   6

Average Turnaround Time: 9.0
Average Waiting Time: 2.33
```
