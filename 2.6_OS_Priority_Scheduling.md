## **1. Introduction to Priority Scheduling**  
Priority Scheduling is a **CPU scheduling algorithm** where each process is assigned a **priority value**, and the CPU is allocated to the process with the **highest priority**.  

- **Type:** Can be **Preemptive** or **Non-Preemptive**  
- **Used For:** Systems where some processes are more important than others (e.g., real-time systems, OS process scheduling)  
- **Preemption:** Can be enabled or disabled  
- **Fairness:** If not managed properly, **low-priority processes may starve**  

---

## **2. Types of Priority Scheduling**  
1. **Non-Preemptive Priority Scheduling**  
   - The CPU selects the process with the highest priority from the ready queue.  
   - Once a process starts execution, it **runs until completion**.  
   - Lower-priority processes must wait for higher-priority ones to complete.  

2. **Preemptive Priority Scheduling**  
   - If a new process arrives with a higher priority than the currently running process, it **preempts** the running process.  
   - The preempted process moves back to the ready queue.

## **3. Priority Scheduling Working Steps**  
1. **Process Arrival**: Each process is assigned an arrival time and a priority.  
2. **Queue Sorting**: The scheduler sorts processes based on priority.  
3. **Execution Selection**: The process with the highest priority is executed first.  
4. **Completion**: The process runs until completion (Non-Preemptive) or may be interrupted by a higher-priority process (Preemptive).  
5. **Turnaround Time (TAT) and Waiting Time (WT) Calculation**.

## **4. Example Execution of Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)**  
Consider the following **processes**:

| Process | Arrival Time (AT) | Burst Time (BT) | Priority |
|---------|------------------|-----------------|----------|
| P1      | 0 ms             | 3 ms            | 2        |
| P2      | 1 ms             | 5 ms            | 1        |
| P3      | 2 ms             | 2 ms            | 4        |
| P4      | 3 ms             | 4 ms            | 3        |

### **Step-by-Step Execution**
1. **Sort processes by priority (lower number = higher priority).**  
2. **Execute process P2 (Priority 1)**.  
3. **Execute process P1 (Priority 2)**.  
4. **Execute process P4 (Priority 3)**.  
5. **Execute process P3 (Priority 4)**.  

### **Gantt Chart**
```
| P2 | P1 | P4 | P3 |
 1    6    9    13   15
```

### **Completion Time (CT), Turnaround Time (TAT), and Waiting Time (WT)**  

| Process | AT  | BT  | Priority | CT  | TAT = CT - AT | WT = TAT - BT |
|---------|-----|-----|----------|-----|--------------|--------------|
| P1      | 0   | 3   | 2        | 6   | 6 - 0 = 6    | 6 - 3 = 3    |
| P2      | 1   | 5   | 1        | 6   | 6 - 1 = 5    | 5 - 5 = 0    |
| P3      | 2   | 2   | 4        | 15  | 15 - 2 = 13  | 13 - 2 = 11  |
| P4      | 3   | 4   | 3        | 13  | 13 - 3 = 10  | 10 - 4 = 6   |

### **Average Time Calculations**
- **Average Turnaround Time** = (6 + 5 + 13 + 10) / 4 = **8.5 ms**  
- **Average Waiting Time** = (3 + 0 + 11 + 6) / 4 = **5 ms**

| Type            | Non-Preemptive               | Non-Preemptive           | Preemptive                          | Preemptive      | Preemptive/Non-Preemptive |
| Scheduling Criteria | Arrival Time               | Burst Time               | Shortest Remaining Time            | Time Quantum    | Priority |

| Preemption      | No                            | No                        | Yes                                 | Yes             | Yes (if Preemptive) |
| Response Time   | High                          | Low                       | Very Low                            | Moderate        | Varies |
| Fairness        | No                            | No                        | No                                  | Yes             | No (if no aging) |

```java
import java.util.*;

class Process {
    int id, at, bt, priority, ct, tat, wt;

    Process(int id, int at, int bt, int priority) {
        this.id = id;
        this.at = at;
        this.bt = bt;
        this.priority = priority;
    }
}

public class PriorityScheduling {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);

        System.out.print("Enter number of processes: ");
        int n = sc.nextInt();

        Process[] processes = new Process[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            System.out.print("Enter Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority for Process " + (i + 1) + ": ");
            int at = sc.nextInt();
            int bt = sc.nextInt();
            int priority = sc.nextInt();
            processes[i] = new Process(i + 1, at, bt, priority);
        }

        Arrays.sort(processes, Comparator.comparingInt(p -> p.priority));

        int currentTime = 0;
        float totalTAT = 0, totalWT = 0;

        for (Process p : processes) {
            currentTime = Math.max(currentTime, p.at) + p.bt;
            p.ct = currentTime;
            p.tat = p.ct - p.at;
            p.wt = p.tat - p.bt;
            totalTAT += p.tat;
            totalWT += p.wt;
        }

        System.out.println("\nProcess\tAT\tBT\tPriority\tCT\tTAT\tWT");
        for (Process p : processes) {
            System.out.println(p.id + "\t" + p.at + "\t" + p.bt + "\t" + p.priority + "\t\t" + p.ct + "\t" + p.tat + "\t" + p.wt);
        }

        System.out.println("\nAverage Turnaround Time: " + (totalTAT / n));
        System.out.println("Average Waiting Time: " + (totalWT / n));
    }
}
```

✔ **Priority Scheduling gives preference to important tasks**  
✔ **Starvation is a risk**—low-priority processes may wait indefinitely  
✔ **Aging can solve starvation** by increasing priority over time  
✔ **Best for real-time and multitasking operating systems**
