## **📌 3. Kernel in OS**  
### **What is a Kernel?**  
The **Kernel** is the core component of the OS that directly interacts with the hardware. It controls system resources, manages processes, and ensures security.

### **Types of Kernels**  
1. **Monolithic Kernel**  
   - All OS services (memory, process, file, and device management) are in a single kernel.  
   - Fast execution but complex and large.  
   - **Example:** Linux, Unix.  
   
2. **Microkernel**  
   - Minimal kernel functionalities (only essential services like IPC and memory management).  
   - Other services run in **user space**, reducing kernel complexity.  
   - **Example:** Windows NT, Mach [The microkernel for Apple MacOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, and watchOS.], QNX.  
   
3. **Hybrid Kernel**  
   - Combination of **Monolithic and Microkernel** concepts.  
   - **Example:** macOS, Windows 95.  

4. **Exo-Kernel**  
   - **What it does:** It only manages **hardware resources** (like CPU, memory, and storage).  
   - **What it doesn’t do:** It does **not** provide services like file management or process scheduling. Instead, applications must handle those themselves.  
   - **Think of it as:** A raw **hardware manager** that gives complete freedom to applications.  
   - **Example:** **MIT ExoKernel** – used for research in high-performance computing.  
```
📌 Real-World Analogy:  

Imagine a **self-service restaurant**.  
The restaurant (Exo-Kernel) only provides tables, chairs, and raw ingredients.   
You (the application) must **cook your own food** instead of ordering from a menu.  
```
5. **📌 Nano-Kernel (Tiny OS Core)**
   - **What it does:** It is even **smaller than a Microkernel**, handling **only the most basic hardware interactions** (like switching between processes).  
   - **What it doesn’t do:** It leaves most of the OS functionalities (like memory management and device drivers) to **user-level services**.  
   - **Think of it as:** A **super lightweight OS core** that does the bare minimum.  
   - **Example:** Some specialized embedded systems use Nano-Kernels for ultra-fast operations.  

```
📌 Real-World Analogy:

Think of a **skeleton watch** (where you only see the **essential gears moving**). 
A Nano-Kernel is just the **bare minimum** needed to make the system run.  
```
  

| Kernel Type  | Features  | Examples  |
|-------------|-----------|-----------|
| Monolithic  | Fast, large, complex | Linux, Unix |
| Microkernel | Small, modular, slower | Windows NT, QNX |
| Hybrid | Mix of Monolithic & Microkernel | macOS, Windows |
| Exo-Kernel | Hardware-level access | MIT ExoKernel |
| Nano-Kernel | Extremely lightweight | Experimental OS |

## **📌 4. System Calls in OS**  
### **What are System Calls?**  
A **system call** is a way for programs to **request services** from the OS kernel (e.g., file handling, process control).  

### **Types of System Calls**  
1. **Process Control** – `fork()`, `exec()`, `exit()`, `wait()`  
2. **File Management** – `open()`, `read()`, `write()`, `close()`  
3. **Device Management** – `ioctl()`, `read()`, `write()`  
4. **Information Maintenance** – `getpid()`, `getppid()`, `settimeofday()`  
5. **Communication** – `pipe()`, `shmget()`, `msgget()`, `socket()`  

### **Example: Process Creation using fork()**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
    int pid = fork();
    if (pid == 0)
        printf("Child Process\n");
    else
        printf("Parent Process\n");
    return 0;
}
```
👉 `fork()` creates a child process. If `pid == 0`, it’s the child process, otherwise, it’s the parent.

## **📌 5. Privileged Instructions & Dual Mode Operation**  
### **What are Privileged Instructions?**  
Privileged instructions **can only be executed in kernel mode** to protect the system.  

### **Examples of Privileged Instructions:**  
1. Modifying CPU registers (e.g., setting interrupt flags).  
2. Directly accessing I/O devices.  
3. Allocating/deallocating memory.  
4. Changing mode bits (User → Kernel).  

### **Dual Mode Operation**  
To protect OS resources, modern systems operate in **two modes**:  
1. **User Mode** – Runs application programs, restricted access.  
2. **Kernel Mode** – Runs OS code, privileged instructions allowed.  

👉 **Mode bit (0 = Kernel, 1 = User)** determines current execution mode.

### **Example: How Mode Switching Works?**
1. **User mode execution**: Running a normal program.  
2. **System call request** (e.g., file read).  
3. **Mode switches to Kernel mode** to execute privileged instruction.  
4. **Returns to User mode** after completing execution.
