### **Operating System and Its Types**
The main purpose of an **Operating System (OS)** is to act as an interface between hardware and software, managing system resources such as CPU, memory, and storage to ensure efficient execution of programs.

**Types of Operating Systems:**
1. **Batch OS** – Executes a batch of jobs without user interaction.
2. **Time-Sharing OS** – Allows multiple users to access the system simultaneously.
3. **Distributed OS** – Uses multiple computers to share processing tasks.
4. **Real-Time OS (RTOS)** – Processes data in real-time with minimal delay.
5. **Embedded OS** – Designed for embedded systems like IoT devices.
6. **Network OS** – Provides networking capabilities, allowing resource sharing.

### **Socket, Kernel, and Monolithic Kernel**
- **Socket:** A software endpoint for communication between processes over a network using protocols like TCP/IP.
- **Kernel:** The core component of an OS that manages hardware and system resources.
- **Monolithic Kernel:** A type of kernel where all OS functions (memory management, process scheduling, file system) are integrated into a single layer, leading to high performance but less modularity.

---

### **Process, Program, and Thread**
- **Process:** An executing instance of a program with its own memory space.
- **Program:** A passive set of instructions stored on disk.
- **Thread:** The smallest unit of execution within a process, sharing resources like memory.

**Types of Processes:**
1. **Foreground Process** – Requires user interaction.
2. **Background Process** – Runs without user input.
3. **Zombie Process** – Completed execution but still in the process table.
4. **Orphan Process** – Parent process has terminated while the child is still running.

### **Virtual Memory, Thrashing, and Threads**
- **Virtual Memory:** A memory management technique that uses disk space as an extension of RAM.
- **Thrashing:** A condition where excessive swapping between RAM and disk degrades system performance.
- **Threads:** Lightweight processes that share the same address space, allowing efficient task execution.

---

### **RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks)**
RAID is used to improve performance, fault tolerance, or both in storage systems.

**Types of RAID:**
1. **RAID 0:** Striping (High speed, no redundancy).
2. **RAID 1:** Mirroring (High redundancy).
3. **RAID 5:** Striping with parity (Fault tolerance and efficiency).
4. **RAID 10:** Combination of RAID 1 and RAID 0 (High redundancy and performance).

---

### **Deadlock and Its Conditions**
A deadlock occurs when processes wait indefinitely for resources held by each other.

**Necessary Conditions for Deadlock (Coffman Conditions):**
1. **Mutual Exclusion** – Only one process can access a resource at a time.
2. **Hold and Wait** – A process holding a resource waits for another.
3. **No Preemption** – Resources cannot be forcibly taken away.
4. **Circular Wait** – A circular chain of processes exists where each is waiting for a resource held by another.

---

### **Fragmentation and Its Types**
- **Fragmentation:** Wastage of memory due to inefficient allocation.
1. **Internal Fragmentation** – Wastage within allocated memory.
2. **External Fragmentation** – Wastage due to scattered free spaces.

---

### **Spooling**
Spooling (Simultaneous Peripheral Operations Online) is a technique where data is stored in a queue before processing, commonly used in printing.

---

### **Semaphore and Mutex (Differences)**
- **Semaphore:** A signaling mechanism used to control access to resources.
- **Mutex (Mutual Exclusion):** A locking mechanism ensuring only one thread accesses a resource at a time.

**Binary Semaphore:** A semaphore with values 0 and 1, used for mutual exclusion.

---

### **Belady’s Anomaly**
A phenomenon in which increasing the number of page frames results in **more page faults** in **FIFO page replacement algorithms**.

---

### **Starvation and Aging in OS**
- **Starvation:** A low-priority process is indefinitely delayed.
- **Aging:** A technique that gradually increases the priority of waiting processes to prevent starvation.

---

### **Why Does Thrashing Occur?**
Thrashing occurs when a system spends more time swapping pages between RAM and disk rather than executing processes, usually due to **overloading**.

---

### **Paging and Its Importance**
Paging is a memory management scheme that eliminates fragmentation by dividing memory into fixed-sized **pages**.

**Need for Paging:**
- Avoids external fragmentation.
- Efficient memory utilization.

---

### **Demand Paging and Segmentation**
- **Demand Paging:** Pages are loaded into memory only when required.
- **Segmentation:** Memory is divided into segments based on logical divisions (e.g., functions, arrays).

---

### **Real-Time Operating System (RTOS) and Its Types**
RTOS is designed for applications requiring **immediate response**.

**Types:**
1. **Hard RTOS** – Strict time constraints (e.g., medical systems).
2. **Soft RTOS** – Timing is important but not strict (e.g., multimedia).

### **Main Memory vs. Secondary Memory**
| Feature | Main Memory | Secondary Memory |
|---------|------------|------------------|
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Volatility | Volatile | Non-volatile |
| Cost | Expensive | Cheaper |
| Example | RAM | HDD, SSD |

---

### **Dynamic Binding**
Dynamic binding links function calls to their definitions at runtime, improving flexibility.

---

### **CPU Scheduling Algorithms**
1. **FCFS (First-Come, First-Served)** – Processes are executed in the order they arrive.
2. **SJF (Shortest Job First)** – Shortest process executes first.
3. **SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)** – Shortest remaining process executes next.
4. **LRTF (Longest Remaining Time First)** – Opposite of SRTF.
5. **Priority Scheduling** – Highest priority process executes first.
6. **Round Robin (RR)** – Each process gets a fixed time slot.

---

### **Producer-Consumer Problem**
A classic synchronization problem where producers generate data and consumers process it, requiring synchronization to avoid race conditions.

---

### **Banker’s Algorithm**
A deadlock avoidance algorithm that checks whether resource allocation will lead to a safe state.

---

### **Cache Memory**
A small, high-speed memory located between the CPU and RAM to store frequently accessed data.

---

### **Direct Mapping vs. Associative Mapping**
| Feature | Direct Mapping | Associative Mapping |
|---------|--------------|--------------------|
| Mapping Method | One block to one cache line | Any block to any line |
| Speed | Faster | Slower |
| Flexibility | Low | High |

---

### **Multitasking vs. Multiprocessing**
| Feature | Multitasking | Multiprocessing |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Definition | Multiple processes run on a single CPU | Multiple processors execute tasks |
| Efficiency | High CPU utilization | Parallel execution |
| Example | Windows OS | Multi-core processors |
